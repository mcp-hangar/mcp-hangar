- Security audit: `docs/security/AUTH_SECURITY_AUDIT.md`
- Updated mkdocs navigation

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Event Store Implementation**: Full Event Sourcing support with persistence
  - `IEventStore` interface with SQLite and In-Memory implementations
  - Optimistic concurrency control for concurrent event appends
  - Event serialization/deserialization with JSON support
  - Integration with EventBus for automatic event persistence
  - `publish_to_stream()` and `publish_aggregate_events()` methods
  - Configurable via `event_store` section in config.yaml
  - Complete test coverage (33 new tests)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-14

### Skipped

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Langfuse Integration**: Optional LLM observability with Langfuse
  - Full trace lifecycle management (start, end, error handling)
  - Span nesting for tool invocations and provider operations
  - Automatic score recording for health checks and success rates
  - Graceful degradation when Langfuse is unavailable
  - Configuration via environment variables or config file

- **Testcontainers Support**: Production-grade integration testing
  - PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Langfuse container fixtures

### Changed
- **Monitoring Stack Simplified**: Cleaner configuration structure

  - Added Grafana datasource provisioning
  - Removed obsolete `version` attribute from docker-compose

### Fixed
- Fixed testcontainers import error in CI when library not installed
- Fixed Prometheus metrics `info` type (changed to `gauge` for compatibility)
- Fixed import sorting across all modules (ruff isort)
- Fixed documentation links to point to GitHub Pages
- Removed unused imports and variables

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-12

### Added
- **Observability Module**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing support

  - Kubernetes-compatible health endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/startup`)
  - Pre-built Grafana dashboard for overview metrics
  - Prometheus alert rules (critical and warning)
  - Alertmanager configuration template
  - Documentation at `docs/guides/OBSERVABILITY.md`

- **Provider Groups**: Load balancing and high availability for multiple providers
  - Group multiple providers of the same type into a single logical unit
  - Five load balancing strategies: `round_robin`, `weighted_round_robin`, `least_connections`, `random`, `priority`
  - Automatic member health tracking with configurable thresholds
  - Group-level circuit breaker for cascading failure protection
  - Automatic retry on failure with different member selection
  - New tools: `registry_group_list`, `registry_group_rebalance`
  - Transparent API - existing tools work seamlessly with groups
  - Domain events for group lifecycle: `GroupCreated`, `GroupMemberAdded`, `GroupStateChanged`, etc.
  - Comprehensive documentation in `docs/PROVIDER_GROUPS.md`
